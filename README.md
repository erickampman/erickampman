I've been a software developer for many years, and am proficient in Swift, Objective-C(++), C++ and C, with a minor in Python. 

I've worked at Fortune 500 companies, startups, and multibillion ARR companies with extreme YoY revenue growth. Currently I'm an independent developer.

I'm focused on iOS and MacOS multiplatform target apps. 
Latest:
- AudMod software synth on the Apple Store for macOS, a phase modulation and waveshaping synthesizer. Check it out -- it's free!
  - https://apps.apple.com/us/app/audmod/id6448872823?mt=12
- TSP software synth, still in alpha. Waiting on a bug fix from Apple (exception, causes the plugin to fail). TSP stands for "Triangle, Sawtooth, Pulse" (oscillators).
  - This includes multiple routing options for lots of flexibility
  - Will be available for macOS and ipadOS
  - I'm about ready to give up on Apple and remove all the text fields on macOS so I can release this. This bug is still there after about a half a year, and a new OS (Sequoia). C'mon Apple!
  
- Job Interview Help app, released! "Get That Job" is available
  - macOS / iOS / ipadOS -- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/get-that-job/id6590602427

I have lots of public repositories demonstrating various aspects of
- Swift
- SwiftUI
- SwiftData
- KVO/KVC

Please check them out, especially if you are getting up to speed on Apple's newer APIs with SwiftUI and SwiftData.
