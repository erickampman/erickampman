I've been a software developer for many years, and am proficient in Swift, Objective-C(++), C++ and C, with a minor in Python. 

I've worked at Fortune 500 companies, startups, and multibillion ARR companies with extremet YoY revenue growth. Currently I'm an independent developer.

I'm focused on iOS and MacOS multiplatform target apps. 
Latest projects:
- AudMod software synth on the Apple Store for macOS, a phase modulation and waveshaping synthesizer. Check it out -- it's free!
- TSP software synth, still in alpha. Waiting on a bug fix from Apple. TSP stands for "Triangle, Sawtooth, Pulse" (oscillators).
  - This includes multiple routing options for lots of flexibility
  - Will be available for macOS and ipadOS
- Job Search apps, in progress. Will be macOS / iOS / ipadOS


I have lots of public repositories demonstrating various aspects of
- Swift
- SwiftUI
- SwiftData
- KVO/KVC
Please check them out, especially if you are getting up to speed on Apple's newer APIs with SwiftUI and SwiftData.
