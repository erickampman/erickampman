I'm Eric Kampman. I've been a software developer for many years, mostly in the embedded C world. I'm actively pursuing iOS and MacOS development, and am currently working on iOS/MacOS AudioUnits. I've released AudMod on the Apple Store for macOS, a phase modulation and waveshaping synthesizer. Check it out -- it's free! Also delving into MIDI 2.0, SwiftUI and SwiftData.
