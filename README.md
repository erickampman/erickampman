I'm Eric Kampman. I've been a software developer for many years, mostly in the embedded C world. I actively pursue iOS and MacOS development on the side, and am currently working on iOS/MacOS AudioUnits, which I plan on releasing on the Apple store, once I've got both Intel and ARM properly targetted (waiting on the 16" ARM MacBook Pro :)
